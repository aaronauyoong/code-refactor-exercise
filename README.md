# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
Project Owner - Aaron Au Yoong

## Introduction
This is a refactoring assignment, to update a marketing agency's codebase to ensure it follows accessibility standards and optimized for search engines. Currently, the source code does not contain semantic HTML elements, and does not have a clear logical structure of styling and positioning. Additionally, there are no meta tags that would aid in optimizing it for search engines. Additionally, the stylesheet does not follow a logical, sequential structure, making it slightly hard to decipher.

## Technologies
Technologies used in this refactoring assignment include the base HTML code provided, alongside the provided CSS style sheet. Assets such as images to be used on the website were provided as well. 

## Project Requirements
Below are the requirements for this refactoring project. 
- Webpage meets accessibility standards.
- Semantic HTML elements visible in the source code. 
- HTML elements follow a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning.
- Image elements contain alt attributes. 
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order. 
- Title element is concise and descriptive. 

## Enhancements made (HTML)
Below are a list of improvements made to the HTML source code:
- Added comments to highlight key areas, for easier notation and reference for future developers who may work on this code.
- Modified webpage title to <title>Horiseon Social Solution Services</title>.
- Added a meta tag to aid in search engine optimisation. Attributes added include keywords & description. 
- Added semantic elements to replace the generic div in the original source code. Semantic elements include header, nav, section, article, footer.
- Added proper indentation for easier visualisation of parent and child tags. 
- Added a title attribute to the div tag for the primary background image to aid with accessibility.
- Fixed the broken link for Search Engine Optimization in the new nav segment, so it leads to the correct part of the webpage. 
- Added '&nbsp &nbsp' to separate each link in the nav segment. 
- Added class="footer h2" to style h2 in the footer. 

## Enhancements made (CSS)
- Added comments to highlight key areas, for easier notation for future developers who may work on this code.
- Re-ordered/rearranged the style sheet, so it follows a logical & clear structure.
- Added a nav CSS segment so the new section can fit with the website theme.
